  <h2>Selected Portfolio Pieces</h2>
            <h3>Written by / Sound Design by:</h3>
            <p>For this project, I wrote and created an ASMR Travel Podcast for Google Arts and Culture. I adapted concepts from a team of contributors into a contiguous script, worked with producers and client representitives to refine it, wrote the final script, and directed the voice acting. I then designed and mixed the soundtrack and effects. </a>

        <h3>Comedy Writing / Voice Acting:</h3>
        <p>Comedy has always been one of my passions and I've been fortunate enough to write scripts and sketches for many top clients. I'm best known for my work for Cyanide & Happiness. I've written dozens of scripts and contributed to numerous successful projects, including "The Cyanide & Happiness Show" and their animated shorts on YouTube. Most recently, I wrote and acted for their video game series, Freakpocalypse, the first chapter of which was released on Steam, Switch, and Playstation.

        <h3>Multimedia Articles for Google Arts & Culture:</h3>
         <p>
            In addition to writing social media copy and scripts for videos, I've written and edited more than 50 multimedia articles featured on the Google Arts & Culture homepage. Using my own pitches and the client's assignments, I used their proprietary CMS to create each post, sourced and edited the media, and wrote the captions. The pieces I enjoyed most explored the fascinating intersections of art, science, and history.
