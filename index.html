        I'm a writer, editor, and media producer with experience in entertainment, journalism, copywriting, and more. Clients and agencies around the world have contracted me to conceptualize, produce, and deliver a wide variety of creative content. Some of my favorite work is featured below.

    <h2>Multimedia Articles for Google Arts & Culture:</h2>
    <p>
        In addition to writing social media copy and scripts for videos, I've written and edited more than 50 multimedia articles featured on the Google Arts & Culture homepage. I developed stories from my own pitches and the client's assignments, then used their proprietary CMS to create each post, sourced and edited the media, and wrote the captions. The pieces I enjoyed writing most explore the fascinating intersections of art, science, and history.

    <h2>Written by / Sound Design by:</h2>
    <p>For this project, I wrote and created an ASMR-inspired travel podcast for Google Arts & Culture. I adapted concepts from a team of contributors into a contiguous script, worked with producers and client representatives to refine it, wrote the final script, and directed the voice acting. I then designed and mixed the soundtrack and effects.

    <h2>Comedy Writing / Voice Acting:</h2>
    <p>Comedy has always been one of my passions and I've been fortunate enough to write scripts and sketches for many
        top-tier clients. I'm best known for my work for Cyanide & Happiness &#8212; I've written dozens of scripts and contributed
        to numerous successful projects, including "The Cyanide & Happiness Show" and their animated shorts on YouTube.
        Most recently, I wrote and acted for their video game series, Freakpocalypse, the first chapter of which was
        released on Steam, Switch, and Playstation.  <a

    <h2>SEO Content:</h2>
    <p>From consumer travel guides to technical documentation, I've written search-optimized content for small companies and major brands from all over the globe. I'm adept at matching tones and styles, and I tailor each piece of content to be clear for the correct audience. Check out a blog I wrote on how to maintain antique rings below.
